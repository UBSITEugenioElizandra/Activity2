<h1><B>Chichen Adobo/ Adobong Manok</B></h1>
<CENTER><img src="images/AM.jpg" alt="Chichen Adobo" width="800" height="500" >
<p>Chicken Adobo is a type of Filipino chicken stew. Chicken pieces are marinated in soy sauce and spices, pan-fried,<br> 
and stewed until tender. The dish gained popularity because of its delicious taste and ease in preparation.</p>
<p>It tastes just right and the cooking time is around 30 minutes. The best way to eat chicken adobo is to have it with <br>
    warm white rice. The combo is simply known as Chicken Adobo and Rice. Pouring some of the adobo sauce over rice before <br>
    eating is a good idea because it makes it more flavorful.</p>

<h2><B>Ingredients</B></h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;"> 
    <li>2 lbs chicken cut into serving pieces</li>
    <li>3 pieces dried bay leaves</li>
    <li>8 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic crushed</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt optional</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon whole peppercorn</li>
</ul>

<h3><B>How to Cook Chicken Adobo</B></h3>
<ol type="a">
    <li>Start by marinating the chicken in soy sauce and garlic. The garlic needs to be crushed for best results. This process <br>
        takes 1 hour to 12 hours depending on how flavorful you want the dish to be. Sometimes marinating for an hour is not enough.<br>
         I think that 3 hours is optimal. The chicken absorbs most of the flavors from the soy sauce and garlic during this step. It is <br>
         noticeable when you taste the dish after cooking. Note that it is also possible to include the vinegar in this step.
    </li>
    <li>The next step is to separate the chicken from the marinade. Make sure to set the marinade aside because it will be used later<br>
         on. Pan-fry the chicken pieces for 1 to 1 Â½ minutes per side. This will partially cook the outer part. It also makes the skin <br>
         tough enough to withstand stewing later. This means that it will remain intact, which is nice for presentation.
    </li>
    <li>Pour marinade into the pot and add water. Let boil. The bay leaves and whole peppercorn can now be added. The process takes 20 <br>
        to 25 minutes depending on the quality of the chicken. However, feel free to cook longer in low heat for a super tender chicken adobo.
    </li>
    <li>
        Add the vinegar. This can also be added as a part of the marinade. Let it cook for 10 minutes and then add sugar and salt. I only <br>
        add salt if needed. It is important to taste your dish before adding seasonings.
    </li>
    <li>
        Filipino chicken adobo can be served with or without sauce. If you like it very tasty then continue to cook on an uncovered cooking <br>
        pot until the liquid completely evaporates.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3><B>Instructions</B></h3>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Combine chicken, soy sauce, and garlic in a large bowl. Mix well. Marinate the chicken for at least 1 hour. Note: the longer the time,<br>
         the better
    </li>
    <li>
        Heat a cooking pot. Pour cooking oil.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the oil is hot enough, pan-fry the marinated chicken for 2 minutes per side.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour-in the remaining marinade, including garlic. Add water. Bring to a boil
    </li>
    <li>
        Add dried bay leaves and whole peppercorn. Simmer for 30 minutes or until the chicken gets tender
    </li>
    <li>
        Add vinegar. Stir and cook for 10 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Put-in the sugar, and salt. Stir and turn the heat off.Serve hot. Share and Enjoy!
