<h1><CENTER>New Technology Trends for 2021</h1>
<p><CENTER>By Nikita Duggal</p><br>

<p1><CENTER>Technology today is evolving at such a rapid pace, enabling faster change and progress, causing an <br>
    acceleration of the rate of change, until eventually it will become exponential. However, it is <br>
    not only technology trends and top technologies that are evolving, a lot more has changed this year <br>
    due to the outbreak of COVID-19 making IT professionals realize that their role will not stay the <br>
    same in the contactless world tomorrow. And an IT professional in 2020-21 will constantly be <br>
    learning, unlearning and relearning (out of necessity if not desire).</p1>
<p1><CENTER>What does this mean for you? It means staying current with new technology trends. And it means<br> 
    keeping your eyes on the future to know which skills you’ll need to know to secure a safe job tomorrow and even <br>
    learn how to get there. All bows to the worldwide pandemic, most of the global IT population is sitting back, <br>
    working from home. And if you wish to make the most of your time at home, here are top 10 new technology trends <br>
    you should watch for and make an attempt at in 2021, and possibly secure one of the jobs that will be created by <br>
    these new technology trends.</CENTER></p1>

<h2 style="text-align: left;">1. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">
    Artificial Intelligence, or AI, has already received a lot of buzz in the past decade, but it continues to be one<br>
     of the new technology trends because of its notable effects on how we live, work and play are only in the early <br>
     stages. AI is already known for its superiority in image and speech recognition, navigation apps, smartphone <br>
     personal assistants, ride-sharing apps and so much more.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
    The AI market will grow to a $190 billion industry by 2025 with global spending on cognitive and AI systems reaching<br>
     over $57 billion in 2021.  With AI spreading its wings across sectors, new jobs will be created in development,<br>
     programming, testing, support and maintenance, to name a few. On the other hand AI also offers some of the highest<br>
     salaries today ranging from over $1,25,000 per year (machine learning engineer) to $145,000 per year (AI architect)<br>
     - making it the top new technology trend you must watch out for!</p>

<h3>2. Blockchain</h3>
<p style="text-align: right;">Although most people think of blockchain technology in relation to cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, blockchain offers <br>
    security that is useful in many other ways. In the simplest of terms, blockchain can be described as data you can only <br>
    add to, not take away from or change. Hence the term “chain” because you’re making a chain of data. Not being able to <br>
    change the previous blocks is what makes it so secure. In addition, blockchains are consensus-driven, so no one entity <br>
    can take control of the data. With blockchain, you don’t need a trusted third-party to oversee or validate transactions.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">Several industries are involving and implementing blockchain, and as the use of blockchain technology increases, so too <br>
    does the demand for skilled professionals. From a birds eye view, a blockchain developer specializes in developing and <br>
    implementing architecture and solutions using blockchain technology. The average yearly salary of a <br>blockchain developer is ₹469K. </p>

<h4>3. 5G</h4>
<p style="text-align: left;">The next technology trend that follows the IoT is 5G. Where 3G and 4G technologies have enabled us to browse the internet,<br>
    use data driven services, increased bandwidths for streaming on Spotify or YouTube and so much more, 5G services are <br>
    expected to revolutionize our lives. by enabling services that rely on advanced technologies like AR and VR, alongside<br>
    cloud based gaming services like Google Stadia, NVidia GeForce Now and much more. It is expected to be used in factories,<br>
    HD cameras that help improve safety and traffic management, smart grid control and smart retail too.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Just about every telecom company like Verizon, Tmobile, Apple, Nokia Corp, QualComm, are now working on creating 5G<br>
    applications. 5G services are expected to launch worldwide in 2021 with more than 50 operators offering services in <br>
    about 30 countries by the end of 2021, making it a new technology trend you must watch out for, and also save a spot in.</p>

<h5>4. Cyber Security</h5>
<p style="text-align: right;">Cyber security might not seem like an emerging technology, given that it has been around for a while, but it is evolving <br>
    just as other technologies are. That’s in part because threats are constantly new. The malevolent hackers who are trying<br>
    to illegally access data are not going to give up any time soon, and they will continue to find ways to get through even<br>
    the toughest security measures. It’s also in part because new technology is being adapted to enhance security. As long <br>
    as we have hackers, cybersecurity will remain a trending technology because it will constantly evolve to defend against <br>
    those hackers.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">As proof of the strong need for cybersecurity professionals, the number of cybersecurity jobs is growing three times faster<br>
    than other tech jobs. Also, the need for proper cyber security is so high that by 2021, $6 trillion will be spent globally <br>
    on cybersecurity.</p>
